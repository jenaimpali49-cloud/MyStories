                     ""The Kingdom Beneath the Last Monsoon""
                     ========================================



In the southern lands where the monsoon clouds arrived like marching armies, there stood a forgotten village at the 
edge of a forest no map dared to name. The villagers called it Vellicholai — the Silver Grove — because the leaves 
shimmered like moonlight even under the harsh sun.

Every year, when the final monsoon rain fell, the elders forbade anyone from entering the forest.

But seventeen-year-old Kavin had never been good at obeying rules.

On the night the last rain began, he followed a silver glow between the trees.

The air inside the forest felt alive. Raindrops hung motionless in midair. Roots rose from the earth like sleeping 
serpents. And in the distance, something pulsed — a blue light beating like a heart.

Kavin stepped into a clearing.

At its center stood a stone doorway, half-buried in moss, carved with symbols that seemed to shift when he tried to 
focus on them.

As the final drop of monsoon rain touched the ground, the doorway opened.

Beyond it lay a city of impossible beauty.

Floating towers spiraled upward like conch shells. Rivers of light flowed through the streets. Creatures with 
translucent wings drifted above glowing gardens. The sky shimmered in shades of violet and gold, as if sunset had been 
painted across eternity.

A voice echoed behind him.

“You have entered Aruvam, the Kingdom Beneeth Form.”

Kavin turned to see a woman whose hair flowed like liquid silver and whose eyes held constellations.

“I am Ilaara, Keeper of Thresholds,” she said. “No human has crossed into our realm for three hundred monsoons.”

Kavin swallowed. “I didn’t mean to. I just followed the light.”

She studied him as though reading a book written in a forgotten language.

“The light does not call the curious,” she said softly. “It calls the needed.”
