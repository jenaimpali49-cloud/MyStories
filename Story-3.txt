                                    ""The Trial of the Root""
                                    =========================


To heal the Root of Tides, Kavin had to descend into its heart — a cavern filled with whispering shadows. The deeper 
he walked, the louder the voices became.

You are too small.
You will fail.
Turn back.

The shadows took shapes from his fears: his father’s disappointment, his own doubts, the hunger he’d seen during a 
drought year.

Kavin fell to his knees.

Then he remembered his mother placing seeds into dry soil, whispering, Rain always returns.

He stood.

“I am afraid,” he said into the darkness. “But I will not leave.”

The cavern fell silent.

A single drop of glowing water formed above him and fell into the roots.

Light exploded through the cavern, racing upward through the tree, through the city, through the doorway, and into the 
sky beyond.
