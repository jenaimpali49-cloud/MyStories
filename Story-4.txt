                                    ""The Return of Rain""
                                    =====================
                                    

Kavin awoke at the forest edge at dawn.

Behind him, the doorway was gone.

Before him, clouds gathered.

By afternoon, rain poured across the land — heavier than any monsoon in living memory.

The elders watched in awe.

That night, Kavin noticed something glowing faintly beneath his skin, like rivers of blue light.

And when the next monsoon season ended, he heard it again —

a distant pulse from the forest,

waiting.
